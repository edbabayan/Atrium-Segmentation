# Atrium-Segmentation
This repository contains an atrium segmentation model based on the U-Net architecture. The model is designed to accurately segment the atrium from medical imaging data, which is critical for various cardiac analysis tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the atrium segmentation model is from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon, a comprehensive collection of medical imaging datasets. This dataset provides high-quality, annotated images across a variety of medical conditions and imaging modalities, making it ideal for training robust segmentation models.
